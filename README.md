# TurnDiff
A physics-guided null-space diffusion framework for sparse-view CT reconstruction. STRIDE integrates range-null space decomposition to ensure projection data consistency and employs a temporally varying reweighting strategy to dynamically correct distribution shifts during the sampling process.
